Hi Freshman Music,

Welcome back! Next week we'll get together with Mr. Carey's class to sing *Herzliebster Jesu*. Here's what to practice before then:



**1. Learn Your Part**

[Here's a page](https://davidforrest.github.io/FR_Music/resources/bach_hj.html) where you can hear each part of *Herzliebster Jesu*, individually and together with the other parts. Use this recording along with the score on p. 69 of the Manual to become familiar with your part.



**2. Tonescapes**

[Here are recordings](https://davidforrest.github.io/FR_Music/resources/add_4th_5th.html) that add the 4th and 5th in each of our three modes. There's also a recording that plays all of the tensions (both kinds of 3rd and 6th together) with the Dorian mode. 

Practice recognizing the tensions in each mode, then see if you can tell the different kinds of 3rds and 6ths apart when they’re all played together in the same mode. Remember that the light 3rd and heavy 6th will sound like they don’t fit with the Dorian tonescape, and this will help you recognize them at first.



**3. Note Reading**

Keep building your speed at [reading notes](https://davidforrest.github.io/FR_Music/resources/SR_notes.pdf).

Here's an [Online Metronome](https://metronom.us/en/). Set it to 60 BPM (Beats Per Minute), and make it your goal to read at least one note for each three ticks, right on the beat. Feel free to go faster if you can.



Let me know if you have any questions, and enjoy your week!

Mr. Forrest
