All of us at St. John's, of course, have a unique affection for Euclid. And as it happens, Euclid didn't just write *Elements*, but he also wrote a bunch of other stuff. And one of the other things he wrote was a music treatise - *Division of a Monochord*. 

As in *Elements*, it begins with a short paragraph of text introducing the axioms, definitions, the things you'll need to know in advance before you start into the propositions. And it's a very cool document to help us begin asking what it means to think about music. 

So here I've broken that paragraph into eight "preliminaries." let's go through those together:

#### 1. (Read)

So in order for there to be sound, there has to be movement. That certainly doesn't sound like the constructions we know from *Elements*.

Is this just a different subject matter? With a closer connection to the physical world? Let's read on...



#### 2. Demo: Frequent & Intermittent Pulsation

Demo on the [Tone Generator](https://szynalski.com/tone#1,squ,v0.75): Set to 1Hz, square wave. Say I was just knocking on the table once per second. It's a pretty nice beat. But what happens if I make it faster?

Ok, we get into Harley Davidson territory.

So now I'm at 10x per second, 16, 40 (starts to sound like a pitch), 160, 520 knocks on the table per second... go all the way up into, say, the 2000s, then back down to 1Hz.

So, apparently, music is made of pulsations.



#### 3. Activity: Reaching the Proper Point (first time singing)

So now we've created parts that allow us to increase and decrease motion, but let's try something with our voices.

Start with two people: both close your eyes, count to three, and sing any pitch. Then listen to what you're both singing and try to match each other, To get to the same pitch. Let a few different pairs of people try it.

You'll have to put enough air through your voice&mdash;sometimes people hum so quietly that they don't even qutie make a pitch. Take a good deep breath (so that your stomach expands, rather than your chest), and hum at about the same volume as you would if you were speaking. Try making that sound as a group.  It's putting yourself out there, singing kind of even more vulnerable maybe, But humming at a speaking volume is also a comfortable way to start&mdash; you're not *singing*, projecting like a soloist or someone making a speech&mdash; you're just using your voice eto make a pitch.

Now, there's a very nice (and cheesy) analogy here, to sitting around a seminar table. Because at St. John's, as Freshmen, we are finding our voices, listening to others closely and carefully, and attuning ourselves to blend  with each other, and attuning ourselves to blend together as a group. Matching pitch is a nice way to think about what we're doing around the seminar table.

Try matching pitch with three people: again, close your eyes, count to three, sing any pitch, and try to find your way to the same pitch.

It may happen that your group (or pair) will end up with two different pitches. Pitches that blend together, but that aren't the same pitch. Let's for now remember that this happened (if it happens), because it will come back as we continue into Euclid's rational account of music. But then try to reach the same pitch. It may help to demonstrate starting from the different, blending pitches, and bringing one to match the other.

Another thing worth mentioning on a first time singing: if anyone believes themselves to be tone deaf (or anything of that sort), this is extremely unlikely. If someone is truly tone deaf, you'd hear a lack of inflection in their speech, a lack of normal prosody, it would be very apparent. If singing or matching pitches, or hearing the difference between pitches feels difficult or impossible, it's most likely because you've never really given focused attention to doing it before. That you didn't have the conditions as you were growing up to develop sensitivity to that sort of thing, and that's perfectly normal. It's a skill that you build, either implicitly or explicitly.

So we will have some very different experiences of singing and listening around the table, and that will be a strength. If one person strugles with hearing something at first, and pays close attention to what about the experience is difficult, that person will likely be able to help us understand something new about listening, or about the process of learning, of developing a perception. Really taking these kinds of challenges seriously is how we come to understand the process of building a skill, both within ourselves, and collectively as a group.

Finally, try matching a pitch as a whole group. What is it that causes one particular pitch to become the "proper" pitch? It may be, as in seminar, that one person is especially empathetic and moves toward something that will help the group, or that there is one dominant voice that others gravitate toward, or that enough of a majority of people, perhaps sitting near each other, find one pitch and that pitch gradually gains prominence. It's a challenge, of course, to find one pitch together as a whole group. we might, again, end up with a couple, or a few different pitches that still sound good together. Try choosing and hearing the "proper" pitch in advance and compare these experiences. 



#### 4. Compunded From Parts

Now in the tone generator, I used a square wave, because that sound has very clear, distinct parts. But if I sing a note, and you sing a note, and we both sing lower and lower notes until we're all the way down in the realm of vocal fry, we'll get our own versions of the part. But the "part" of my voice and of your voice are going to be different, they have different timbres, they're different sounding knocks.

So the idea of "part" is something maybe more abstract than the intantiation of part in the sounding world. And that perhaps takes us back into the world of *Elements*, where you might have an idea in your imagination of a triangle, but if you had to instantiate it in the world, it wouldn't be that perfect triangle, it would be something that's not quite purely a triangle. And so there may also be a difference here between "part" and any instantiation of part.

Which is interesing to think about. How do you locate a concept? Does it actually exist in the sounding world? Are the things we're using to describe music really music at all? Do they have anything to do with it? If so, what's the relationship?



#### 5...8



#### notes to incorporate:

- euclid wrote a music theory text
- it usually is presented as purely mathematical, but there are some interesting philosophical points it raises beyond the math
- for one, it shows the difference between voice and an instrument. you can "tighten" and "loosen" tones to reach the properly tuned pitch with your voice
- [Pitch matching, voice "tuning" activity]
- but there's no way to go further into the rational account—you need a tool for that, an instrument. And this is the first encounter with theory.
- this text explicitly invokes the physical, sounding world, and then makes an account of sound as being made of "parts" in order to get to magnitudes, which introduces beautifully and subtly the separation of theory from music. the concepts it begins to build around music have the same relation to the world as the diagrams in euclid's elements—they are of a different sort than anything that can exist in the physical world—they are generalized and abstracted from the physical, and yet especially in the case of music, they're derived sounding realities and also capable of being the source of sounding realities. 
- that relationship between the concept and music is so significant, and is introduced here. and it's the transition from the sound to the "part" that's the interface here.
- analogy to lab: not the building blocks of music, but creative tools we lay over an infinite and mysterious world. tools we can work with. And: philosophical ideas embedded in symbols.
- it's also starkly apparent from the transition from the preliminaries to the first proposition. the propositions entirely depart from the considerations of sound and motion in the preliminaries. they will give us the equality of multiple ratios, but it's left to us to invoke the musical significance of octave equivalence.
