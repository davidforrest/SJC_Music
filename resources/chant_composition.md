### Chant Composition



​	**To prepare:**

- Check out [these examples](https://davidforrest.github.io/FR_Music/resources/gregorian_notation_examples.pdf) of Gregorian illuminated manuscripts.
- Check out [these anonymous chants](https://davidforrest.github.io/FR_Music/resources/2023_spring_chants_anon.pdf) created last semester by the Monasterium Freshman Musica...
- Look through the chants in the Manual on pp. 21-36, and listen to some of the recordings below. You can follow along with the Gregorian neume notation in the Manual as you listen. This is to get a feeling for the sound of Gregorian chant:
  - *Hodie Christus natus est* (p. 21)
    - [Joel Cohen, Boston Camerata](https://youtu.be/gPEPKJbAWEc)
  - *Kyrie Orbis factor* - ornamented (p. 29)
    - [Westminster Cathedral Choir](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHx8PIjP34U)
  - *Pange Lingua* - Phrygian (p. 31)
    - [Choeur Gregorien de Paris](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AsvDn87fo)
  - *Veni Creator Spiritus* (p. 34)
    - [Schola Cantorum of Amsterdam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kphky63gK5I)

- Read the short excerpt from Guido of Arezzo's *Micrologus*, Manual pp. 38-40, on composing a chant.
- Also take a look at the list of Gregorian notation symbols in the Manual on pp. 95-96.



​	**To compose your chant:**

- Use the [Music Calligraphy Kit](https://davidforrest.github.io/FR_Music/resources/calligraphy_kit.html), which currently lives in our classroom (not at Switchboard as usual). Bring your friends!
- Choose a short (chant-length) text that you like, and break it into syllables. Some possibilities:
  - A favorite poem or song lyrics
  - The St. John’s motto: *Facio liberos ex liberis libris libraque*
  - The text of one of the chants in the Manual
- Choose a final (an anchor note) for your chant. First turn on the [Tonescape](https://davidforrest.github.io/FR_Music/resources/tonescapes_0.mp3), then choose one of the following notes to be your final, which will define the mode of your chant. Your chant should end on this note.

  - [Option 1](https://szynalski.com/tone#G3,v0.75) (G)
  - [Option 2](https://www.szynalski.com/tone-generator/#D3,v0.75) (D)
  - [Option 3](https://szynalski.com/tone#F3,v0.75) (F)
  - [Option 4](https://szynalski.com/tone#E3,v0.75) (E)
- Choose a reciting tone. If your final is note number 1, count up to note number 5, and this is your reciting tone. For example, the note on the syllable “e” in "Ho-di-e” is a reciting tone that repeats throughout the chant. You can use the reciting tone to contrast with your final.
- Start by singing along with the tonescape to compose your chant. Once it starts sounding good, notate what you sing.

  - Consider the range of your chant. It could be as few as 5 notes (between the final and reciting tone), or as many as 9, if you use the full range from the space below the staff to the space above it. You’ll have to place your final on a line or space so that the range of your chant will fit on the staff. 
- Have fun, and by all means, feel free to go all out illuminating (decorating) your manuscript!
