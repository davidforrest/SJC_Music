Hi Freshman Music,

Next week we‚Äôll keep working on *Sicut Cervus.* [Here‚Äôs a page](https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdavidforrest.github.io%2FFR_Music%2Fresources%2Fsicut.html&data=05|01|David.Forrest@sjc.edu|75d772fc33a14d81463508db438d5e10|f39b2a6e912b4008ab21cf8340cfe999|1|0|638178046680785868|Unknown|TWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D|3000|||&sdata=AplAfAUIFZobMihrzFR6SGXnfLIzrPEkhuVexpKsPxA%3D&reserved=0) where you can hear each part individually and together with the other parts. I hope this is helpful as you learn your part‚Äî I‚Äôd suggest boosting the volume for your part and reading along with the score on p. 61 of the Manual. And remember to use the ‚ÄúPlay All‚Äù button so all the parts start at the same time (although it‚Äôs pretty fun to listen to what happens when they get out of sync, too‚Ä¶)

üé∂,

Mr. Forrest
