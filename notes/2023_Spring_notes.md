**Notes**

- we can't do Euclid with just our voice. Brings up the need for an instrument. The relationship of an instrument to a concept.
- also an opportunity to talk briefly about the harmonic series, and the meaning of consonance and dissonance.
- two strings as a ratio: bottom as the fundamental, top as the interval.
  - 2:1 the fundamental is divided by 2 parts, the interval is 1 of those parts
  - 3:2 the fundamental is divided by 3 parts, the interval is 2 of those parts
  - 4:3 the fundamental is divided by 4 parts, the interval is 3 of those parts
- Then match those pitches with the voice



### The Ancient Greek Musical System

**Location**

**References**

- 2023 Spring Wk1

**Notes**

- Look at this in combination with the next section on the Orestes fragment
- you need a clear construction of the ancient greek system
- random, intuitive tetrachords with moveable notes
- conjunct and disjunct tetrachords
- and hear some of these
- relate to the inifinity of possible things we hear in a pop song, vs what our concepts capture.
- theory v practice: construction of a greater theoretical system to encompass them
- build a clearer explanation of the greek names
- start with a lyre and the names of 7 strings, two conjunct tetrachords
- again, this can only exist on an instrument—how would it be possible with just the voice? the voice is intuition, instruments are theory.
- then expand the names to the full system that euclid will build
- "proslambanomenos" is the first concept of note, abstracted from a string
- Proslambanomenos, ‘the note we take as an extra’. Its masculine form shows that its inventor had forgotten all idea of a string (chorde); he was thinking of it simply as a note (phthongos). (West 222)
- then build it by euclid's propositions
- and maybe also tell that the same system is built in Timaeus.
- and look at greek notation, and a piece notated that way
- btw, there are theoretical names for the notes that are different from the notated names. based on instruments (strings of the lyre). is this like the difference between letter names and notational symbols? is there a similarity to independent solfege, as names for independent notes, based on a 12-note instrument...?
- get to a piece this way, and sing it together.
- or maybe, sing first, improvise, and notate it in something like Ancient Greek notation
- maybe just the vocal part, with an awareness that there's also an instrumental and rhythmic part
- see how much is and isn't captured. so much isn't captured. we have no idea what ancient greek music sounded like

**Notes**

- Shapes Lessons 13 & 15
- melting the diatonic system, or putting it in a big room. or a soup.
- and interestingly, a way to put a rational layer on the voice.
- which we will gradually internalize. that's right, logos is a kind of instrumental layer we're embedding in our voice, intuition, ears, body. that's so strange.
- but our tonescape exercise introduces the anchor note.
- the diatonic singing took the place of playing with shapes on the keyboard, without names or anchors. the free improvisation.
- the anchor note
- doesn't appear in notation
- does appear in theory
- we do have an intuition for it in pop songs, sort of, but not as strongly as the diatonic set
- it is implied in the fundamental, the starting note when we construct our system
- but we don't always hear or use it that way—songs can use different anchors than the one the overall system was built from. maybe a throwback to the pre-system, messy tetrachord scene.
- so we'll establish it here. 
- assignment: the two tonescape exercises



### The Musical Staff and Gregorian Notation

**Location**

**References**

- 2023 Spring Wk2

**Notes**

- So we've created our musical system (pythagorean)
- then build the same system by odo's.
- and given it letter names with octave equivalence
- Now we're going to start working with the staff system. not quite our modern system, but an earlier version of that system--Gregorian notation. But this shows us aspects of our current system.
- The lines and spaces themselves. In principle, there can be as few or as many as we want. Our modern system has five lines, Gregorian has four. The considerations are, for one, the range of the music we're notating, and two, that once we have so many lines, it becomes hard to recognize a distinctive position on the staff quickly.
- we have our diatonic group of notes, represented by our tonescape (tonescape alone). we can choose any one of those notes, and place it anywhere on the staff, and the lines and spaces become stepwise relationships within that group. 
- Clefs: if we weren't here to sing and say "put this note here," we'd need a symbol to map the musical system to the staff. This is done with the letter positions we've constructed. Remember that they're positions--not notes.
- In modern notation, we use the "G," "F," and "C" clefs. These evolved from Gregorian notation, which used the "C" and "F" clefs. (any F clefs in the chants in the manual?). We've developed standard practices for where those clefs go on the staff, but in principle they can go anywhere. So if you know modern notation, and this is a "G" because the treble clef is on the second line, you can move it, and *this* becomes a "G."
- Today we're going to leave the clef out, because we can play with mapping different contexts to the same notation. Also, let's invent a new kind of clef today: the anchor clef. Draw it as an arrow (or a half diamond) on the line or space that you want to be the anchor. Also, again, the word "anchor" isn't a standard term in music theory. You'll more often hear something like "tonic" or "tonal center," and in Gregorian chant, this note is called the "final," and appears as the final note of the chant.
- But "anchor" is a perception we're playing with--it's a way to orient ourselves. And we can orient ourselves in different ways to the same piece of music. 



### Music Calligraphy: *Hodie Christus natus est*

**Location**

**References**

- 2023 Spring Wk2

**Notes**

- So we'll play around with notating Hodie, which will also be a way of learning to sing it. Start by looking at the unit of the syllable. Get to singing the whole chant together, and emphasize a couple different anchors (the final, and the starting note of the chant). Probably we'll tend to hear the starting note as the anchor. Is this cultural? Dominance of the major mode? We're going to start to get some control over this.
- transcribe from manual, ID gregorian neume types
- make something artistic
- *Facio liberos ex liberis libris libraque*
- add a calligraphy yt video resource?

### Three Note Naming Systems

**Location**

**References**

- 23.2.8 Ms Fargo notes (wk3).jpg
- 2023 Spring Wk3

**Notes**

- **Outline (Take 0)**

  - diatonic order
  - choose an anchor
  - can switch anchors
  - uneven spacing (w/diff anchors) creates modes
  - 2 kinds of names:
    - letters show the absolute positions in the diatonic order
    - numbers show positions relative to the anchor
  - Clefs:
    - place the letter positions on the staff.
    - but they don't tell us the anchor. so let's also make up an anchor clef. 
      - if we had only the anchor clef, we'd still need something else to tell us which note is the anchor. and we'd have no way to know the mode. 
  - So we're good. Until we decide we want a different mode on one of our notes (as long as we don't have a modulating system).
  - How to do that?
    - am I taking a "light/heavy" approach to modes?
    - or a historical "start this mode on this note" approach?
    - this may also be the difference between introducing modes and accidentals.
    - remember, any accidental is either a departure, or a shift to a different mode.

- **Outline (Take 1)**

  - diatonic, switch anchors, read chants

    - why do modes sound different? uneven spacing! 
      - monochord spacings with hodie start v. final?

    - letter positions represent these uneven spaces absolutely.
      - C clef, F clef. Then later, G clef. --> modern clefs.


  - but we hear notes relative to the anchor: Ut Queant Laxis. 

  - apply Ut Queant to the monochord: "Fa" is different when starting on "F"

  - thus accidentals. B-flat. Repeat on G to get F sharp.

  - if you repeat this process, you end up adding more and more notes "in between" the notes of your system. (endlessly more, to be revisited when we talk about tunings)

  - abstract Ut-Re-Mi to numbers. so the relationships aren't necessarily attached to a single mode.

- a problem: the staff itself is in a key. so you need a key signature to differentiate accidentals that are departures vs. that define the key. but then you're reading notes in terms of letter positions from a different key. Which takes us back to the experience of our reading contours in a tonescape in Hodie--that's what it feels like.

- **Outline Take 2**: "ABC, 123, Do Re Mi, baby you and me"

  - we started with intuitions, built a musical system, and gave it letter names.

    - we sang around that system, and reoriented to different anchors. 
      - why do the different anchors create different moods/modes? uneven spacing of the notes (letter positions) in our musical system!
      - when we can't sing "put this note here," we can use a clef: "put a C or an F here." (Guido came up with this--why C and F? the sound?)

    - And we can use numbers to start a mode from any letter position.
      - the evenness of the numbers correspond to the evenness of the lines and spaces of the staff--we hear these as degrees.

    - But what if we wanted the sound of the C mode, but starting on F?
      - Ut Queant Laxis --> the uneven distances in the diatonic system, but abstracted from the letters. ("diatonic syllables")
      - so we can make Ut (which would be the "C" mode), starting on "F," as is done in Hodie. And then we need a new note--a "heavy" version of the "B."
      - Filling things out in this way, we can populate a 12 note system, with "heavy" and "lightened" variations of the letters, that modify the letters differently, depending on which mode we want to create from which letter name..

  - So accidentals establish / set the staff to a different mode or anchor. 

  - But they can also be departures from the existing mode or anchor
    - move the accidentals that establish the context into a key signature, then the remaining accidentals are departures from that context.
      - this matches what we hear, since we'll be listening in the context of the key signature.
      - and raises the question: is a momentary departure from context a move into a different context? (TBC in *Ave Verum Corpus*)

- From West intro: For a fuller review see Neubecker. 16-38. Of the authors and works I ~ave mentioned, the following are translated, with excellent introductions and notes, in Barker, GMW: the pseudo-Aristotelian Problems (selection). Arisoxenus. Euclid. Nichomacus, Ptolemy, pseudo-Plutarch, Athenaeus (selection, Aristides Quintilanus
- Aristoxenus’ Elementa Harmonica,
  - Of especial importance is Aristoxenus of Tarentum, a pupil of Aristotle. A number ofhismany works were to do wuh music m one aspect or another. Nearly all of them are lost regrettably, though valuable fragments are preserved by Athenaeus and others. What has survived in a more continuous state consists of a few pages from his Elements of Rhythm and three books of Har-monics, the first of which represents a different treatise from the rest; the third book breaks off in mid-argument. 
  - 'Harmonics·. in ancient terminology, is the science dealing with the ordered arrangement of notes in scales and the relationships between scales: It was not concerned like modern harmonic theory with chords and chord-successions. 
  - Aristoxenus' harmonic theory was highly influential, and it is regurgitated in several works written probably between the second and fifth centuries AD, where lost portions of Aristoxenus' exposition are also reflected. These works are the Introductions to Harmonics of Cleonides and Gau- dentius, the Introductions to Music ofBacchius and Alypius, and the much longer and more wide-ranging work On Music by Aristides Quintilianus.Cleonides' lucid handbook, formerly misattributed to Euclid, is the most purely Aristoxenian.
- Euclid Sectio Canonis or Division of the kanon
  - Other works of about Aristoxenus' time or soon after it are the Sectio Canonis or Division of the kanon, which may be a genuine work of Euclid's 
  - The Sectio Canonis is a short treatment of harmony from the mathematical angle, the kanon being the graduated rule of a monochord which gives out different notes according to the length of the resonating section of the string. This approach is also represented in several works of the first half of the second century AD: 
    - Theon of Smyrna's Explanation ofMathematical Matters for Readers of Plato, 
    - Nicomachus of Gerasa's Harmonic Handbook, 
    - and, much more important, the Harmonics of Ptolemy. 
    - In the third century the Neoplatonist Porphyry wrote a commentary on Ptolemy's work. This too contains some useful matter. 
- (pseudo-)Aristotelian Problems. 
  - The Problems are a collection of about 900 scientific questions in the form 'Why is it that .. .' with reasoned suggestions for answers, arranged under thirty-eight headings and put together in the Peri- patetic school. Two of the sections, the eleventh and nineteenth, are concerned withmatters of acoustics and harmony respectively. 
- The Epicurean philosopher Philodemus (first century BC) wrote a work on music which is partially preserved; 
  - it is a polemic agains tthe view that music has ethical effects on the listener. 
- Sextus Empiricus (ADc. 200) argues similarly in his essay Against the Musicians, which forms the sixth book of his Against the Scientists. 
- The dialogue On Music which comes down to us as a work of Plutarch's, but is certainly not by him, 
  - is a source of unique value for the early history of Greek music, or at least for what was believed about it in the Classi- cal period. Though itself late-perhaps of about Athenaeus' time-it cites excellent Classical authorities such as Glaucus of Rhegium (c.400 BC, author of a book On the Ancient Poets and Musicians), Heraclides Ponticus (mid-fourth century BC), and Anstoxenus (lost writings), and it paraphrases substantial excerpts from them m undigested form.
- There is the Chrestomathy of the fifth-century Neoplatonist Proclus, a history of poetry of which half survives in an epitome by Photius; and a brief discussion of tragedy by Michael Psellus (eleventh century), not published until I963 by R. Browning
- Many elements of Greek theory were taken over by the Arab writers on music, the most important of whom is Abu n-Nasr Mulhammad ibn Muhlammad ibn Tarlhan ibn 'Uzlag al-Farabi, popularly known as AI-Farabi (c. 870-950).
- Martianus' De nuptiis Philologiae et Mercurii is a survey of the liberal arts. The treatment of music, which occupies the ninth book, is based primarily on Aristides Quintilianus. 
  - Two Latin authors occasionally cited are Martianus Capella (early fifth century) and Boethius
- Boethius, De Institutione Musica, tr. Calvin Bower (New Haven: Yale UP, 1989), excerpts. 
  - Boethius (early sixth century) too is writing a com- pendium of the subject as one branch of the higher learning among others. His main authorities are Nicomachus, Cleonides, and Ptolemy. Though he has little of independent value for our inquiry, he is of great historical significance as the point of departure for medieval theorists.
- Since there are many Pythagoreans, we will split up the readings into the most important schools: early Pythagoreans up to (and including) Archytas, Plato, Aristotle, Theon, Nicomachus. We will leave out the “big” later names, like Ptolemy and Euklid, unless there is specific interest.
- Claudius Ptolemy is the great synthesizer of later antiquity, who tried to mediate between the Pythagorean and Aristoxenian positions.
- Even after the correlation between frequency and pitch was discovered and explored under Joseph Sauveur and others in the 17th century 
- the frequency of sound was surprisingly hard to measure. (Around 1666 the important British experimental scientist Robert Hooke came up with an ingenious idea to measure the frequency of given sounds. The same mechanism later became known as Savart’s wheel.
