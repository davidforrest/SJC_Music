#### At Home

##### For Wednesday

**1. Get to know Viderunt Omnes**

[Here’s a simple page](https://davidforrest.github.io/SJC_Music/viderunt_aeterna) with a button that will shuffle a few different recordings of the chant... forever. Really get to know this chant. Try listening in the background while you do other work. Also try listening with your full attention. And try following along with the recordings using the three versions of your score (the Manual version, the handout, and your copy).

See if you can get to the point where you can sing the chant from memory.

And If you’re interested, I left the Calligraphy Kit at Switchboard, so you can check it out and take it to the Coffee Shop to continue illuminating your manuscript. Not a requirement, but it’s there for you.

**2. Read the excerpts from Euclid’s Division of a Monochord in the handout I gave you in class today. **

**3. Read the section in the Manual on The Diatonic Order (pgs. 6-9)**
