### ToDo List

- include add'l readings in the sched: Ptolemy? Aristoxenus? More Boethius?
- organize primary and secondary readings lists (break out of notes)
  - and clean readings out of the FR_Music directory
- choose some particular props to emphasize in class, like multiples 2, 4, 8 being the most consonant, octave equivalence, where's the line of consonance...
- does SJC have a savart wheel?
- remaining euclid props after 19&20?
- rhythm & poetic meter...?
- activity: tune the lyre to a tonescape...
  - or build the greek naming system by ear,  extend it, pair it with a song...?
  - or go around the room matching pitches of the greek system?
- supplemental writings to the propositions

### Misc Notes



#### Terms:

sesquitertia - epitritic - 4:3

pyknon (‘close-packed’): The bunch of three notes close together at the bottom of the enharmonic and chromatic tetrachords. [West 162]

‘Bottom’ was the highest in pitch and ‘uppermost’ the lowest: the terms do not refer directly to pitch," but to the position of the strings on a lyre held tilted away from the body. The strings nearest to the player, therefore, played the lower notes. [West 64]

"tense" (high), "slack" (low) [West 179]

- It was not necessarily higher in pitch overall than a slack mode. It might be that both occupied the range d-d’, for example, but that in the tense mode the melody moved more in the upper part of that octave, in the slack one more in the lower. In any case, ‘tenseness’ must have affected the character of the mode by putting greater strain on the voice and altering its quality. 

​	Proslambanomenos -the note we take as an extra" [West 222].



#### Concepts:

Division of the full scheme into tetrachords (see West p.222 & Levin p.52)

- Hypaton
- Meson
- Diezeugmenon
- [Synemmnon]
- Hyperbolaion

modes & composition using modes

sounds of the diatonic, chromatic, enharmonic genera

...



**Distinct notes found in order:**

A (fundamental)

D (A:D = 4:3)

E (A:E = 3:2)

B (E:B = 3:2)

**G (A:G = 8:9), (D:G = 4:3)**

F (G:F = 8:9)

C (F:C = 3:4)



**So:** 

**(A)** is 4:3 to **(D)**

(A) is 3:2 to **(E)**

(E) is 3:2 to **(B)**

(D) is 4:3 to **(G)**

**(F)** is 9:8 to (G)

**(C)** is 4:3 to (F)





### Readings Notes


Many of the ethnic names applied to the *tonoi* are also applied to *harmoniai* described by Plato (especially *Republic* iii), Aristotle (especially *Politics* viii),

de Anima...

**harmony of the spheres: cf. 1.6 Aristotle** **De Caelo** **290b**

All the concords are contained by the *tetraktys,* since the latter is composed of 1, 2, 3 and 4. In these numbers there is the concord of a fourth, the fifth and the octave, the epitritic ratio, the hemiolic, the duple, the triple and the quadruple. (Barker p.218)

- These numbers form the *'tetraktys* of the decad', summing to the number 10. It had great significance in early Pythagorean numerology: see 1.2 Sextus Emp. *Adv. Math.* VII. 94-5 with n. 3. (Barker p.30)



Tetractys:

Sextus Empiricus

Theon of Smyrna - Mathematical Expositions (?)

Iamblichus - The Life of Pythagoras (?)

philolaus - from nicomachus (flora levin)

levin p.8 "The literature on the *tetraktys* is vast. For perti- nent references, see F. R. Levin, *The Harmonics of Nicomachus and the Pythagorean Tradition*, p. 65, n. 62."

Plato *Timaeus* (ca. 375 BCE)

- 35-37 (really 35b-36b) soul as ratios, then 37 motion creates time. (Barker pdf pp. 1239-1241)

  - "They represent an attempt to translate the facts of this experience into the language of mathematics, where their implications and interrelations can be rigorously studied." (Barker)
    - propositions 10-13 demonstrate the ratios of the principal musical concords, and that of the tone. 
    - Propositions 14-16 are proofs of subsidiary theses that follow from a 'Pythagorean' treatment of intervals as ratios, but which are quite at odds with Aristoxenian methods of analysis. 
    - Proposition 17 shows how to locate certain notes in the enharmonic genus by means of concords, and proposition 18 has a further anti-Aristoxenian argument about the intervals thereby formed. 
    - Finally, propositions 19—20 show how to divide the string of a monochord in ratios that give a system in the diatonic genus: this is the 'division of the kanon' from which the work gets its name.
  - prop 11 involves an elementary logical fallacy (Barker)

Ptolemy *Harmonics* (ca. 120 BCE)

- Book 1 chs. 5-6, and 7 too (Barker pdf p.296) on problems with linking consonance to multiple and superparticular ratios, esp the octave plus fourth (ratio 8:3)
- Book 1 ch. 9 the crucial weakness of Aristoxenian harmonics lies in its conception of a note as a mere *point' on a continuum of pitch, a conception which apparently gives no distinguishing features to the note itself. (Barker p.211)

Aristides Quintilianus *De Musica* (1st century CE)
