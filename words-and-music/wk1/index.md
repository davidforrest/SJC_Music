### Words and Music - Week 1

Some questions to keep in mind as you read, that weave their way through these pages:

**On Memory**: Does a memory have to be real, and what makes a memory real? Does a musical memory focus more on the music, or on the moment? Does being "memorable" describe a quality of the music itself? What other sensations accompany memories of sound? What does the sound represent? Does the moment make you more open to noticing something about the music?

**On Words**: Does the writing itself have a rhythm? Does it feel musical? Is a melody a kind of language? Is music enhanced by words, by their meanings, by stories, or is it something separate? Can you say that a song and life are synonyms? What kinds of words describe sounds, and what kinds of words describe feelings? Do sounds describe feelings?

**On Music**: What causes music to be "good" or "beautiful?" Is it a quality of the music itself, or something outside the music?  What kind of skill, if any, is involved in making beautiful music, or experiencing music as beautiful, or powerful? What makes it one piece of music, if two people experience it in different ways? Is a feeling a part of the music, or something outside the music?
