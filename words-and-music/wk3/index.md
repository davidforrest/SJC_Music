### Words and Music - Week 3

Here's a first pass at rounding up different ways of writing about music from your pages. Can you help me refine this list?

- on political, philosophical, spiritual aspects of music
- on significance to a group, or to an individual
- focusing on a musical *gesture* to bridge abstract and concrete, general and particular
- on physical, anthropomorphic, embodied aspects of music
- music as representational: of images, sensations, desires...
- music as rational, ordered, deliberate, segmented...
- as narrative, temporal, experiential, environmental...
- writing *as* music: rhythmic, poetic, onomatopoetic...
