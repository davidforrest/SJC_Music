### Words and Music - Week 3

Here's a first pass at rounding up different ways of writing about music from your pages. Can you help me refine this list?

- on political, philosophical, spiritual aspects of music
- on significance to a group, or to an individual
- focusing on a musical *gesture* to bridge abstract and concrete, general and particular
- on physical, anthropomorphic, embodied aspects of music
- music as representational: of images, sensations, desires...
- music as rational, ordered, deliberate, segmented...
- as narrative, temporal, experiential, environmental...
- writing *as* music: rhythmic, poetic, onomatopoetic...

**Next week's prompt:**

Choose one of the pieces we listened to last week (ideally, one that captures your interest) and explore it through two of our <a href="../musical_terms/" target="_blank">musical terms</a>. You might choose two terms that seem very closely related and try to discover what distinguishes them, or choose two terms that seem completely unrelated and try to discover their connections. The idea is to develop a better understanding of those terms by considering them in relation to one another, an in relation to a piece of music. 

And although the focus is on one piece and two terms, feel free to include other pieces or terms in your exploration. Because, as we discovered in class, making sense of a term often involves grouping or connecting it with other terms, or considering how it behaves across different pieces of music.
