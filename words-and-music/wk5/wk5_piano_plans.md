1. Imagine yourself preparing and playing a piece of music on the piano in a casual performance at the end of the semester. What would make this feel like a meaningful accomplishment for you? Is there a particular feeling, skill, or interest that the experience could be a means of exploring?

In math, when we talk about knowing a proposition, we say that you know it when you can hold all pieces of the proposition in your head at once. It doesn't feel like there are discrete parts, but rather a continuous argument. I want that with music, to be able to hold a whole piece in my head without memorization, but with a flow, an argument, a necessity for one part to come after the other part. However, for this to be meaningful, I don't want a piece that is too easy to memorize, or that only plays one note at a time. A challenge like having to play multiple notes at once would force me to find different methods of holding the piece entirely in my head. In math, understanding methods gives you an understanding of the whole, rather than just the parts. 

2. What piece/song would you like to work on for that performance? If you can, include a score or YouTube link, etc. that you might use to learn the piece. If you know what piece you’d like to play but not how you’d go about learning it, include a link to a recording. And if you have no idea what you’d like to play, try to describe the qualities of a piece that might interest you, so we can try to find one together.

I want to learn Sicut Cervus. In order to accomplish my goal of challenging myself and my memory, I want to aim to learn two parts of the piece, the alto and another complementary part. Maybe the soprano part, since it differs plenty from the alto section? I am not yet clear on exactly which parts I would choose, which parts would be physically doable to learn in conjunction, etc. However, the reason why I chose this piece is because I have learned over the past year an intuition for this piece of music unlike any other piece we have listened to. Even without knowing the translation of the lyrics, I am able to hold a frame of the song in my head when singing it, as well as the trend of the notes. I want to see if my interpretation of these trends changes when I learn the underlying tones, the piano parts.

I have already chosen my piece: Sonata No.8 'Pathetique' 3rd movt. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJpSqC86vaw](https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DlJpSqC86vaw&data=05|01|David.Forrest@sjc.edu|b19dbf5da6c74ee1f7f108dbc1640e50|f39b2a6e912b4008ab21cf8340cfe999|1|0|638316407816168453|Unknown|TWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D|3000|||&sdata=8ZuK9v3B%2Fl%2FYAJ%2FLKPXOoSvAHNIpBI9YLKI%2FkuwQ%2F1A%3D&reserved=0)

 

What I want to work on is to learn how to express the melodies as musically as possible. (being able to emphasized melody one the one hand and being able to play harmony one the other hand)

I have started to work on with music assistant. I am worried though, if it is to long.

Let me know if there is any concern about me playing this piece or any suggestions for what I should be working on as I learn it.

Thank you.

1. Technically, I'm most hopeful to improve on keeping time. I'm getting to the point where I can read the notes and I can memorize the way the song goes, but to be able to play in a smooth and flowing way is still on the horizon. Feeling-wise, I am most attracted to those piano solos that feel like sad asides that people are just voyeuristically observing, I like sad piano songs that the pianist seems completely involved in.
2. I've been looking all week. There's this piano cover of a Kanye song called After You which I really like but it's a bit short and repetitive (this could be a warmup song). I always liked Chopin and his Nocturne No. 2 (in E-flat major, op. 9 no.2), that seems like a classic first piano song. Otherwise, I've scoured the ends of the earth for something I'd like to learn and haven't found anything (I guess I don't listen to anything with piano). I'd really love to do something by David Bowie or Nina Simone, but haven't found any ideal song to do, and they might be too challenging. Anyway, still on the hunt.

1. I'm interested in being able to play the piano, and it seems like learning a piece is the best way to develop that skill. 
2. I would like to be able to play Christmas Time is Here at the end of the semester. That may or may not be too advanced for me to play by then.

1. It would be fulfilling for me to learn something I find beautiful. My goal is to learn it by heart so that I can enjoy the music while I play it, rather than put all my attention on the playing itself.

 

2. I think I’ll try Bach’s March in E-Flat major, probably to the first or second repeat. I always enjoyed playing Bach in orchestra so I think learning something of his on a new instrument will be fun.

I want to play a piece of music that really excites me, that makes me dance involuntarily, rock back and forth on the piano stool and shake my head. One of my favorite songs of all time is Ella Fitzgerald's "I Can't Get Started". I think it will be a challenge because it is in a jazzy style and therefore there is no definite sheet music for it, but I think that will make it more fun. When I played piano as a kid, I was really good at playing by ear. I could listen to a song and recreate it quickly with no sheet music. I have since lost that ability but want to get it back, which is another reason why I chose a song that doesn't have a defined score. In a way, it would be my own interpretation of the song as opposed to a copy of someone else's work. However, if it proves too difficult, I would also like to play the melody from "l'homme et l'oiseau" by Barbara Pravi, which has a very different vibe but is also a favorite of mine. For the latter song, I want to learn it from just listening to the song, but for Ella's song, I might use this video to help me out until I find better sheet music (if I can):

What I'd like most in a performance is to play with emotion and interpretation, feeling as though the piece is living through me. Such expression comes second to technicality, and therefore I must first learn the means of playing the notes in the best way I can. I know this will be a casual performance, but I still want to play well! I don't have much experience with the piano, and I need to choose a piece that is easy enough to learn in just a few weeks. I'd like to play a more traditional, classical piece, and one that speaks despite its simplicity. My first thought was of a Chopin prelude, many of which are short and appear relatively easy, technically speaking, yet still beautiful. I am leaning towards either number 4 or number 20. I will experiment with them both and come to some conclusion as to a final choice.

Learning piano in music class sounds like a big idea! For the first question, I would think being able to play a song on a piano smoothly will bring a sense of self-value fulfillment; to be more specific, from knowing nothing about the piano to being able to perform a whole song, it would directly show the fruit of my working and the progress of practicing. If I could achieve this by practicing for the whole semester, it would be a lovely thing to play Fur Elise by Beethoven successfully at the end of the semester.

During our meeting today, Mx. Ormsby decided that they wanted to learn some Joplin, specifically, "The Entertainer." I got them a simplified version of the sheet music.
