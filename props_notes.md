### I. Preliminaries



**[Read Euclid Preliminaries First]**



#### 1. Our speaking voice has aspects that are musical.

- prosody in speech
- rhythm in speech?
- timbre in speech?
- amplitude in speech?
- other...?



#### 2. Our musical voice places [turns] attention to these aspects that are musical.



#### 3. Pitch is one aspect of the musical voice.



#### 4. Pitch is a continuous range of high and low.

- what makes them "high" or "low?" 

- are other terms possible?

- a spatial metaphor (notation)?

  

**Activity: Continuous range vocal warmup**



#### 5. We intuitively segment this range into notes.

- the segments exist before we create them rationally
- with these segments we can make music: sing, tune an instrument...
- an account only for the intuition



**Activity: Notes w/pop songs**

**Activity: Tonescapes 1, 2 (A-H-L, A, 2H, 2L)**

#### 6. A note can be a sounding event, or a concept.

- a concept can follow an event, or an event can follow a concept
- each note is both an event and a concept
  - an event in that it happens
  - a concept in that [it has potential]
    - An understanding retained in the mind, from experience, reasoning and/or imagination; a generalization (generic, basic form), or abstraction (mental impression), of a particular set of instances or occurrences (specific, though different, recorded manifestations of the concept).



#### 7. A concept can be intuitive or rational.

- we can think of (recognize, create) events without a rational account. "this is something"
- intuition v reason
- yet we can build a concept, a category, to describe an experience.
- the category is an event



#### 8. A point is where a rational concept touches a sounding event

- this point of contact is impossible.
- impossible transition
  - extremities are points
- impossible transition from the physical world to concept.
- a point has no part, but a note has a part.
- what is a musical "point?" (that which has no part..?)
- a rational account of any musical event, including a note, is necessarily something apart from the musical event itself
  - an event has a beginning
  - a beginning is an extremity
  - an extremity is a point
  - a point has no part



---



#### 9. A note is made of parts.

- [the unit vs the part]
- there is a unit of pulsation
- notes are compounded from parts. --> a compound of parts.
- a note us made up of events
  - a note is (arises from) a regular pulsation
  - pulsation is repetition of motion
- pulsation (or percussion) is an event



**Activity: Tone Generator Demo**



#### 10. There are two senses of "part." one is the magnitude between successive beginnings, and the other is whatever exists between those beginnings.

- what is the part itself?
- like "note," it is abstract / interchangeable
- a PART (or unit) of pulsation is a magnitude
- point as extremity of a magnitude
- pulsation v percussion
- pulsation can be continuous or discrete
  - (pulsation or percussion)
- A pulsation can be discrete or continuous.



---



#### A magnitude between beginnings is a magnitude between points.

- if the pulsation is continuous, a single point is the extremity of two PARTS (magnitudes)
- point as an event when something happens.



#### What exists between beginnings is marked by the beginnings.

- if the pulsation is discrete...
- the unit doesn't matter--only its arrangement in time



#### Parts of a note are repetitions of the same magnitude.

whether continuous or discrete...



#### Parts of a sounding note arise from motion.

- pulsation arises from motion (euclid)
- a motion is a magnitude. Of length? Of speed?



#### Parts of a sounding note exist in time.

- motion takes place in time
- the category/event can be placed in time, or imagined outside of time
- a point must be of time
- part must be independent of time, but be placed at points in time
- magnitudes or more or less frequent = magnitudes of TIME
- the part itself only exists in time. as an event with extremities in time.
- or part as a point in time?
- the unit needs to have duration.



#### Silence is the absence of motion.

- silence must also take place in time
  - if it is absence of motion. 
  - it has potential for motion

### II. Ratio



#### To measure a sounding note requires an instrument.





#### Tightening a string increases motion and decreases the magnitude of each part of the sounding note.



#### Loosening a string decreases motion and increases the magnitude of each part of the sounding note.



#### A magnitude of string length corresponds to the magnitude of each part of the note produced by that string.

- a magnitude on the monochord represents a number of pulsations.



**Demo: Lambda Diagram? & Frequency?**



#### Two different notes can make a single blend.

- these relationships are "closer?"
- create a single sound?
- some proportions make a single blend
- these are in multiple or superparticular ratio
- sounding?





#### A note can only be measured by its relation to another note.

A given note is a magnitude.

Two given notes are two magnitudes.

The first (antecedent) note can be measured by the second (consequent).

The second (consequent) note can be measured by the first (antecedent).

(1:1, 2:1, 3:2, 4:3...)



- sounding and not sounding?
- what is the proper point? a relationship between two pulsations?
- notes are ordered in proportion
- "note" is not attached to a particular pulsation.
- "point" can only exist in relationship.
- "proper point" implies a virtual relationsihp.
- measured, sure, but can a note be "understood" independently? esp a sounding note?





#### A new note can (only) be constructed by its relation to an existing note.

A given note is a magnitude.

The note can be divided into any arbitrary number of parts.

With any number of these parts, we can construct a new note, lesser or greater than the existing note.

(Divide a note in 9 parts, take 8 of those parts. Or divide a note in 8 parts and take 9.)





#### To invert a ratio

what does it do, what does it mean?

the antecedent represents the whole string

and the consequent defines the note (the string length), in terms of parts of the antecedent.

so if the antecedent is larger, the consequent creates a note by taking part of the whole

but if the consequent is larger, it creates a note by adding part of the whole *to* the whole.



so if you compound a ratio with a smaller consequent, the resulting note will be smaller

but if you compound a ratio with a larger consequent



to invert a ratio gives you [the whole you would have started from?]



*

antecedent represents the whole string

consequent gives the note in terms of parts of the whole

but if you only have the note, what was the whole?

2 parts of an original 3

...





#### To find the compound of ratios

Is to ask, if I have a ratio of the whole string, and I take a ratio of that ratio, what ratio of the whole string will result?



To compound two ratios

say, 3:2, 4:3

means to divide an original note into antecedent parts (3),

take a consequent note (2 of those 3),

divide that consequent into a new antecedent parts (4 rather than 2),

take a new consequent note (3 of those 4),

and express the new consequent in terms of the original note.



so dividing the first consequent into 4 rather than 2 means the original note would have been divided into 6 rather than 3.

and taking 3 of those 4 means taking 3 of the original 6.

so the final consequent has a relationship of 6:3, or 2:1 to the original note.



To calculate a compound quickly, multiply the antecedents and the consequents, and reduce if necessary. 

So for 3:2, 4:3

3\*4 : 2\*3 = 12:6 = 2:1 

You can compound any number of ratios by multiplying all the antecedents and all the consequents in this way.



The crux of compounding ratios is the transition from the consequent to a new antecedent. When these numbers are the same, the relationship of the original number to the final consequent becomes much more apparent.

For example, 12:8, 8:6

takes 8 parts of 12, then 6 of those 8, and therefore 6 of the original 12.

You can create this relationship for any ratios by finding a common multiple of the consequent and the new antecedent. 

So for m:n, p:q

find a common multiple, b, for n and p, so that:

​	m:n :: a:b

​	p:q :: b:c

now, a:b :: b:c

and since the consequent and new antecedent are now the same, the compound will be a:c.

So for 3:2, 4:3 

find a common multiple, 8, for 2 and 4, so that:

​	3:2 :: 12:8

​	4:3 :: 8:6

and the compound will be 12:6, or 2:1.





#### To find the difference of ratios

Is to ask, if I have two ratios of the whole string, what ratio, when taken of the first ratio, will produce the second?



Since both ratios were derived from the same whole string,

that string was divided into 3 and into 4. which means both can be divided into their common multiple, 12

adjusting the consequents accordingly, you get 12:8, 12:9 

so the first ratio is 8 parts of the second ratio's 9

and they are in ratio 8:9 to one another.



But while this describes their ratio to one another, it doesn't produce the second from the first.

Because if the first is 8 parts and the second is 9,

then to produce the second from the first, I have to take 9 of 8 parts.

So the difference is 9:8, 

it's the *inverse* of their ratio to one another.



To calculate the difference quickly, invert the second ratio, multiply the antecedents and consequents, and reduce if necessary.

So for 3:2, 4:3 

Invert to 3:2, 3:4 

3\*3 : 2\*4 = 9:8



The crux of finding the difference between two ratios is that the first ratio becomes the new whole.

3:2, 4:3

3\*3 : 2\*4

So in the first ratio, the antecedent represents the whole string, and the consequent is the part of that string that's sounding.

So we want the consequent to become the new whole string, and to know what ratio, when taken of that new whole, will produce the second ratio of the whole string.

In the second ratio, the consequent is also the part that's sounding.

**gosh, we want to find a common multiple for the consequent of the second ratio, and the antecedent of the first ratio, because this will equalize them in the right way.** 



Then the consequent of the second ratio is equal to that new whole.

But since both ratios are still expressed in terms of the original whole string,



What's left is to express these equals in terms of a magnitude that measures them both.

so the original whole (3) times the new whole (3)

and the original parts (2) times the new parts (4)









Is to ask, if I have two ratios of the whole string, what is their ratio to one another, in terms of a magnitude that measures both?

Is to ask, if I have two ratios of the whole string, what ratio, when taken of the first ratio, will produce the second?

Or, the compound of the first ratio and what new ratio will produce the second?

Or, you have two ratios of the whole string, you remove the second from the first, what ratio of the whole string is left over? (i don't know about that one...)

In Ch. 12, Nicomachus says difference is "the excess or deficiency of the notes compared with one another."

### III. Spatial

- alternate, even construction using 3:2 and 2:1 
  - --> uneven spacing within an octave
- notes sound evenly spaced
- spacing compresses on the monochord
- ratios themselves are not compressed
  - octave equivalence allows this?
  - same ratio from two different notes = different magnitudes (9:8)
